# SUMMARY: check that package layering respects rpmdb
# METHOD:
#     - test that during a relayer (e.g. upgrade), if a previously layered pkg
#       is now part of the base layer, then we stop layering but still keep it
#       in the origin
#     - test that layering a pkg that's already in the base layer works
#     - test that layering a pkg that's already layered fails (string match)
#     - test that layering a different provides that's already layered works
#     - test that layering a new pkg that conflicts with a layered pkg fails
#     - test that layering a new pkg that conflicts with a base pkg fails
#     - test that relayering on a base with a conflicting package fails

# make sure the package is not already layered
