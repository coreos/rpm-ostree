    <title>Description</title>

    <para>
      rpm-ostree (also called "atomic" if configured) is a system
      software management tool that combines features of both
      traditional RPM and OSTree.  It has support for both server-side
      composing of trees, as well as client-side upgrading and
      management of deployments.
    </para>

    <para>
      On an rpm-ostree managed system, the traditional
      <literal>yum</literal> (if installed) and <literal>rpm</literal>
      tools operate in a read-only state; the RPM database is stored
      in <literal>/usr/share/rpm</literal> which is underneath a
      read-only bind mount.
    </para>
    <para>
      Instead of live package-by-package upgrades, the underlying
      OSTree layer replicates a complete filesystem tree from a
      compose server into a new deployment, available on the next
      reboot.  One benefit of this is that there will always be a
      previous deployment, available for rollback.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note in this "pure replication" model, at present there is no
      dependency resolution on the client machines, nor any ability to
      add or remove packages.  You may however use /usr/local/bin, or
      an application mechanism such as
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>docker</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.

      <listitem>

        <para>
          Gives information pertaining to the current deployment in use.  Lists the names and refspecs of all possible deployments in order, such that the first deployment in the list is the default upon boot.  The deployment marked with * is the current booted deployment, and marking with 'r' indicates the most recent upgrade (the newest deployment version).

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Gives information pertaining to <literal>rpm</literal> data within the file system trees within the ostree commits. There are three sub-commands:

        <para>
          <command>diff</command> to see how the packages are different between the trees in two commits.
        </para>

        <para>
          <command>list</command> to see which packages are within the commit(s) (works like yum list). At least one commit must be specified, but more than one or a range will also work.
        </para>

        <para>
          <command>version</command> to see the rpmdb version of the packages within the commit (works like yum version nogroups). At least one commit must be specified, but more than one or a range will also work.
