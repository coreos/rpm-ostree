    <title>Description</title>

    <para>
      rpm-ostree is a system software management tool that
      combines features of both traditional RPM and
      OSTree.  At the moment, there are only two available
      commands: <literal>upgrade</literal> and
      <literal>rollback</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      On an rpm-ostree managed system, the traditional
      <literal>yum</literal> and <literal>rpm</literal>
      tools operate in a read-only state.  Instead, the
      underlying OSTree layer replicates a filesystem tree
      from a compose server.  In this "pure replication"
      model, there is no dependency resolution on the
      client machines, nor any ability to add or remove
      packages.

        <listitem><para>Download the latest
        version of the current tree, and
        deploy it, setting it up as the
        default for the next boot.  By design,
        this has no effect on your running
        filesystem tree.  You must reboot for
        any changes to take
        effect.</para>

        <para>
          <command>--reboot</command> or <command>-r </command> to initiate a reboot after upgrade is prepared.

	<listitem><para>OSTree mananges an
	ordered list of bootloader entries,

  the default bootloader entry.  Each entry has

	<filename>/var</filename>.  You can
	use the bootloader to choose between
	entries by pressing Tab to interrupt startup.</para>

        <para>This command then changes the
        default bootloader entry.  If the
        current default is booted, then set
        the default to the previous entry.
        Otherwise, make the currently booted
        tree the default.</para>
        <para>
          <command>--reboot</command> or <command>-r </command> to initiate a reboot after rollback is prepared.

        <para>
          Gives information pertaining to the current deployment in use.  Lists the names and refspecs of all possible deployments in order, such that the first deployment in the list is the default upon boot.  The deployment marked with * is the current booted deployment, and marking with 'r' indicates the most recent upgrade (the newest deployment version).
