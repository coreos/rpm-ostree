# rpm-ostree, aka /usr/bin/atomic
A  system to compose RPMs on a server side into an
[OSTree](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/OSTree)
repository, and a client side tool to perform updates.

The project aims to bring together a hybrid of image-like upgrade
features (reliable replication, atomicity), with package-like
flexibility (seeing package sets inside trees, layering, partial live
updates).

## rpm-ostree is in beta!
While many of the underlying technologies here are stable,
if you are considering using this in your organization, you
should perform a careful evaluation of the whole stack.  Software
updates are obviously critical, and touch on many areas of concern.
