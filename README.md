# rpm-ostree: A true hybrid image/package system

rpm-ostree is a hybrid image/package system.  It combines
[libostree](https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a base image format,
and accepts RPM on both the client and server side, sharing code with the
[dnf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNF_(software)) project; specifically
[libdnf](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/libdnf). and thus bringing
many of the benefits of both together.

 - Transactional, background image-based (versioned/checksummed) upgrades
 - OS rollback without affecting user data (`/usr` but not `/etc`, `/var`) via libostree
 - Client-side package layering (and overrides)
 - Easily make your own: `rpm-ostree compose tree` and [CoreOS Assembler](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler)
