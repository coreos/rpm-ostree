/* An OIRPM is structured as an ordered set of files/directories; we use numeric
 * prefixes to ensure ordering. Most of the files are in GVariant format.
 *
 * An OIRPM starts with the OSTree commit object and its detached metadata,
 * so that can be GPG verified first - if that fails, we can then cleanly
 * abort.
 *
 * Next, we have the "jigdo set" - the NEVRAs + repodata checksum of the
 * RPM packages we need.  So during client side processing, downloads
 * can be initiated for those while we continue to process the OIRPM.
 *
 * The dirmeta/dirtree objects that are referenced by the commit follow.
 *
 * A special optimization is made for "content-identical" new objects,
 * such as the initramfs right now which unfortunately has separate
 * SELinux labels and hence different object checksum.
 *
 * The pure added content objects follow - content objects which won't be
 * generated when we import the packages. One interesting detail is right now
 * this includes the /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/pkg-foo.conf objects that we generate
 * server side, because we don't generate that client side in jigdo mode.
 *
 * Finally, we have the xattr data, which is mostly in support of SELinux
 * labeling (note this is done on the server side still).  In order to
 * dedup content, we have an xattr "string table" which is just an array
 * of xattrs; then there is a GVariant for each package which contains
 * a mapping of "objid" to an unsigned integer index into the xattr table.
 * The "objid" can either be a full path, or a basename if that basename is
 * unique inside a particular package.
