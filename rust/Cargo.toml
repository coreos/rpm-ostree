# Unwinding across FFI boundaries is undefined behavior, and anyways, we're
# [crash-only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash-only_software)
panic = "abort"
# We assume we're being delivered via e.g. RPM which supports split debuginfo
debug = true
# For true release builds, we do suggest you enable LTO via e.g.
# env RUSTFLAGS='-C lto=true' as part of the outer build.  It's just
# off by default because it's quite slow and the default is more oriented
# towards local development.
